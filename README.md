## Overview

This repository runs scheduled security scans across the portfolio. It detects newly disclosed vulnerabilities even when no pull requests or deployments occur.

### Why this exists

PR based security misses newly published CVEs. This repository closes that gap by scanning on a fixed schedule.

## Security Coverage

- Secret scanning
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Container filesystem scanning
- SBOM generation
- Security result reporting

## Scheduling

### Daily Execution

- Runs every day at 17:00 UTC.
- Performs full security scanning.
- Automatically creates a GitHub Issue if critical findings are detected.

### Weekly Reporting

- Runs every Sunday at 18:00 UTC.
- Creates a single weekly security report issue.
- Summarises scan coverage and points to existing evidence.

### Runtime Security Integration

Runtime security events from Kubernetes are generated by Falco.
Falco detects suspicious runtime behaviour such as container escapes, privilege escalation, and unexpected process execution.

Daily security reporting includes references to Falco findings when present.
Critical runtime findings are treated as security alerts and reviewed alongside daily scan results.

- Evidence sources
- Falco logs and events
- Kubernetes audit logs
- Daily security workflow logs
- Weekly security report issues

This keeps build time, deploy time, and runtime signals in one governance flow.

### Alerting Model

Critical findings trigger an automatic GitHub Issue.
Alerts link directly to the workflow run that detected the issue.
No external services are required.
Alerts remain as a permanent audit trail.

### Weekly Reporting Model

One issue is created per week.
Reports summarise coverage, execution, and evidence.
Open security alert issues are referenced for follow up.

### Workflow Design

This repository uses a single GitHub Actions workflow.
The workflow handles daily scanning, alerting, and weekly reporting.
This avoids duplication and keeps logic easy to reason about.

## Evidence and Auditability

All scan results are available in GitHub Actions logs.
SARIF results appear in the GitHub Security tab.
Alerts and reports are tracked as GitHub Issues.
